"""Integration test of the orchestrator.

This test tests the multi-htreaded orchestrator, where a prefill request is
popped onto a prefill queue, prefilled, sent to a generation queue and run for
a number of decoding steps.

In operation, it will use gRPC so we can 'yield' from the function to get return
values in the same way that they would be streamed back.

Similar to 'mock_engine_test' we can use known token values and a singleton
weight to test our operation.

Let the prefill engine have a weight of [2] and the generate engine have a
weight of [3].

I.e. if we prefill [2, 65, 66] (i.e. <BOS>, 'A', 'B') using an ACII vocab,
we should get [4, 130, 132].

If we then insert that and run three generation steps, we should see
266+0 / 2 = 266
266 + [266] / 4  = 332
266 + [266, 332] / 4 = 415
I.e. ['Ċ', 'Ō', 'Ɵ'] when converted back with chr().

Therefore we should get back the character sequence '$lǔ' if we request 3 tokens
decoded (these are the ascii chars at those indices which is what the test
tokenizer returns).
